# growControl
This is my first raspberry pi project, so we will see how it goes.

Grow Control is an experiment with a raspberry pi to control an indoor vegtable growing setup.

The initial goal is to control a light with a few tempature sensors and fans.
Future goals include automated watering, pH testing, and possibly control for hydroponics.
